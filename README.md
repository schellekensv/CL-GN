# CL-GN: Compressive Learning of Generative Networks
This repository contains open-source code that fits a generative neural network to a dataset, using only a compressed representation of it (a sketch), hence "compressive learning".

## Contents
For now, you can find here:
1. The `ESANN-DEMO` notebook that implements CL-GN on simple 2-D toy examples. Those results were published at the [ESANN 2020 conference](https://www.esann.org/), under the name
> Vincent Schellekens and Laurent Jacques, "Compressive Learning of Generative Networks"
2. A frozen copy (18/02/2020) of `pycle` (a toolbox for compressive learning in Python), whose main page is [here](https://github.com/schellekensv/pycle).
